                Mediterranean Inspiration
              </h2>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 mb-4">
                Olive & Ember was born from a passion for authentic Mediterranean cuisine and the timeless tradition of cooking with fire. Our founders traveled extensively through Greece, Turkey, Spain, and Southern Italy, collecting recipes, techniques, and inspiration from local families and village cooks.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 mb-4">
                What struck them most was not just the incredible flavors, but the way food brought communities together around the warmth of wood-fired ovens and ember-kissed grills. They knew they had to bring this spirit of hospitality and authentic cooking to Virginia.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80">
                Today, we honor those traditions while celebrating the incredible seasonal produce and artisanal products available right here in the Mid-Atlantic region.

                <p className="text-charcoal/80 mb-4">
                  Executive Chef Maria Santos brings over 15 years of experience in Mediterranean cuisine to Olive & Ember. Trained in the kitchens of Barcelona and later refined her skills in the fire-cooking traditions of rural Andalusia, Maria is passionate about wood-fired techniques and olive oil-forward cooking.
                </p>
                <p className="text-charcoal/80 mb-4">
                  "Cooking with fire is both ancient and immediate," Maria explains. "Each dish tells a story of the flames, the wood, the season, and the hands that prepared it. We're not just feeding people â€“ we're connecting them to something timeless."
                </p>
                <p className="text-charcoal/80">
                  Under her leadership, our kitchen sources from over a dozen local farms and creates a menu that changes with Virginia's seasons, always staying true to Mediterranean principles of simplicity, quality, and bold flavors.
